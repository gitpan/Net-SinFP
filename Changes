2.08 Wed Jan 12 15:24:24 CET 2011
   - update: new deformation masks

2.06 Mon Dec 18 16:35:25 CET 2006
   - bugfix: in passive mode, when a frame has no TCP layer, do not process it
   - bugfix: in passive mode, when a user specifies -F, SinFP must use it
   - pod: for Result.pm
   - examples: now ships with example files in examples/ directory
   - tests: more tests (pod consistency, pod coverage)
   - new signatures (sinfp-20061218.db, 140 signatures)

2.05 Sat Nov 18 12:40:41 CET 2006
   - bugfix: due to changes in Net::Packet 3.xx, now requires version 3.2x
   - new signatures (sinfp-20061118.db)

2.04 Sun Nov  5 18:59:48 CET 2006
   - Search.pm: new deformation mask added
   - new signatures (sinfp-20061101.db)

2.03 Sun Oct 29 21:57:05 CET 2006
   - Search.pm: new deformation masks added
   - sinfp.pl: default displaying of OS information updated, it is shorter now
   - sinfp.pl: new parameter -C, to show complete OS information like old 
               behaviour
   - new signatures

2.02 Mon Aug 28 19:56:45 CEST 2006
   - bugfix: when analyzing an anonymized pcap file
   - bugfix: test options length for P2 reply, not P3 reply
   - new signatures

2.01 Sun Jul  2 11:52:43 CEST 2006
   - bugfix: when a target responds to P2, but to not P1, we craft 
             a fake P1 reply
   - update: display a warning when a signature is matched in a heuristic mode, 
             but not enough TCP options were received from P2 for a considered 
             reliable match
   - new signatures

2.00 Wed Jun 14 23:33:16 CEST 2006
   - complete rewrite
   - sinfp.db completely reworked
   - new tests based on comparison between probe and response (TCP seq/ack 
     comparison, IP ID value comparison)
   - new matching algorithm, works like a search engine (a problem of finding 
     intersection, by applying a deformation mask on keywords) much more 
     efficient than in 1.xx branch
   - passive fingerprinting much more acurate thanks to new matching algorithm
   - possibility to launch P1P2P3 probes, or only P1P2 probes, or only P2 probe
   - match IPv6 signatures against IPv4 ones
   - API changes, not compatible with 1.xx version anymore
   - DB schema changes, not compatible with 1.xx version anymore
   - many bugfixes

1.02 Wed May 31 18:50:03 CEST 2006
   - bugfix: in RST response to a probe when it has some L7 data
   - compatibility patches with upcoming Net::Packet 3.00

1.01 Sat May 13 13:03:16 CEST 2006
   - sinfp.db: new signatures, bugfix on some
   - sinfp.db: now installs in the same directory as sinfp.pl, no need to 
               be root anymore
   - now uses Class::Gomor::Array instead of Hash

1.00 Mon Mar 13 13:37:01 CET 2006
   - sinfp.db: more signatures (IPv4 and IPv6 ones)
   - sinfp.db: migration from DBD::SQLite 1.08 to 1.11
   - Makefile.PL: now installs sinfp.db into /usr/local/share/sinfp when 
                  installation is run as root
   - Makefile.PL: sinfp.pl, np-anon-pcap.pl, np-read-anon.pl are installed into 
                  /usr/local/bin if installation is run as root
   - SinFP: algorithm to match OSFPs is now quicker (especially in passive mode)
   - SinFP: algorithm to match OSFPs is now also a little better
   - SinFP: bugfix when running in offline passive mode (now skip non IP frames)
   - sinfp.pl: -k parameter to keep generated pcap file (default to not)
               pcap files are especially useful for unknown fingerprints, send 
               them to me ;) (use np-anon-pcap.pl to anonymize IPs)

0.92 Mon Jun 20 23:43:53 CEST 2005
   - first public release
