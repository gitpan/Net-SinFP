Revision history for Perl extension Net::SinFP.

1.02 Wed May 31 18:50:03 CEST 2006
   - bugfix: in RST response to a probe when it has some L7 data
   - compatibility patches with upcoming Net::Packet 3.00

1.01 Sat May 13 13:03:16 CEST 2006
   - sinfp.db: new signatures, bugfix on some
   - sinfp.db: now installs in the same directory as sinfp.pl, no need to 
               be root anymore
   - now uses Class::Gomor::Array instead of Hash

1.00 Mon Mar 13 13:37:01 CET 2006
   - sinfp.db: more signatures (IPv4 and IPv6 ones)
   - sinfp.db: migration from DBD::SQLite 1.08 to 1.11
   - Makefile.PL: now installs sinfp.db into /usr/local/share/sinfp when 
                  installation is run as root
   - Makefile.PL: sinfp.pl, np-anon-pcap.pl, np-read-anon.pl are installed into 
                  /usr/local/bin if installation is run as root
   - SinFP: algorithm to match OSFPs is now quicker (especially in passive mode)
   - SinFP: algorithm to match OSFPs is now also a little better
   - SinFP: bugfix when running in offline passive mode (now skip non IP frames)
   - sinfp.pl: -k parameter to keep generated pcap file (default to not)
               pcap files are especially useful for unknown fingerprints, send 
               them to me ;) (use np-anon-pcap.pl to anonymize IPs)
